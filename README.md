## 💡 My Process

- I started by analyzing the Figma/Frontend Mentor design and breaking it into components.
- Developed step-by-step layout using Flexbox and Grid.
- Implemented client-side form validation and step transitions with JavaScript.
- Focused on mobile-first design and then scaled up for desktop.
- Tested for responsiveness and accessibility.
- Polished the final UI and added error states as shown in the active state designs.
